# Tube Archivist Home Page Functionality

This is the landing page, when you first open **Tube Archivist**. You have a few options to sort and filter that view:
- With the **Sort Order** you can select how the "Recent Videos" are sorted: 
  - **Date Published**: Sorts the list by date when the video was published on YouTube, newest on top.
  - **Date Downloaded**: Sorts the list based on when you have downloaded the video to your archive, newest on top.
- With **Hide Watched** you can filter out videos you have already marked as watched to only show unwatched videos. 
- You can use those two options together to for example filter the list to *Hide Watched* videos **and** sort by date downloaded.

Additionally the search icon <img src="assets/icon-search.png?raw=true" alt="search icon" width="20px" style="margin:0 5px;"> opens a text field to search your collection.
