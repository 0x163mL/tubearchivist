# Video Page

Every video downloaded gets a dedicated page accessible at `/video/<video-id>` of your Tube Archivist.

Clicking on the channel name or the channel icon will bring you to the dedicated channel detail [page](Channels#channel-detail).

The button **Delete Video** will delete that video including the media file.

When available, a playlist navigation will show at the bottom. Clicking on the playlist name will bring you to the dedicated [Playlist Detail](Playlists#playlist-detail) page showing all videos downloaded from that playlist. The number in square brackets indicates the position of the current video in that playlist.

Clicking on the next or previous video name or thumbnail will bring you to that dedicated video page.
